# DialerApp

This app was coded on Android Studio using the Android Java SDK.8U73, and was shared on Github using the VCS option. 

The function is to dial a prescribed number onto a phone, this taught me the fundamentals of Java, and was one of the first apps that I created using Android Studio; and is also published on the Play Store (link to app below).
